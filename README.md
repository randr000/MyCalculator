# MyCalculator
Calculator app for Windows 10. No need for installation.

Update on work computer took away the calculator app. No physical calculator at my desk.

Go to "MyCalculator/MyCalculator/MyCalculator/bin/" and download all the contents in the Release folder.

Alternativly, you download the Release.zip file and then extract on your computer.

Double click the MyCalculator.exe file to open the app. You can also create shortcuts on your desktop and taskbar.

# MyCalculator
Simple Calculator app for Windows 10. No need for installation.

My company upgraded my os to Windows 10 but took away the Calculator app and prevents users from installing anything.

I don't have a physical calculator at my desk and do not always want to open up Excel just to do a simple calculation so I made my own.

Go to "MyCalculator/MyCalculator/MyCalculator/bin/" and download all the contents in the Release folder.

Alternativly, you download the Release.zip file and then extract on your computer.

Double click the MyCalculator.exe file to open the app. You can also create shortcuts on your desktop and taskbar.
